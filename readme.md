# Gate Keeper

Gate Keeper is a tag reader/writer system created using Arduino and the RC522 RFID module.

This system functions as a gate controller, allowing you to register and store user/tag information while verifying whether a scanned tag has access privileges.

Equipped with a user-friendly graphical interface, Gate Keeper simplifies the administration of various tag properties.
